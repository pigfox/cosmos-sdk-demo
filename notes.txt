The address in your logs seems to be incorrectly prefixed with cosmosvaloper instead of cosmos. 
Here's the explanation:

cosmos: This is the prefix used for regular account addresses in the Cosmos SDK. 
These are used for general accounts and balances.
cosmosvaloper: This prefix is used for validator operator addresses in Cosmos. 
These addresses are typically used to control validator nodes.
The error you're seeing is because the system expects a regular address prefixed with cosmos, 
but it found a validator address with the cosmosvaloper prefix.

To fix the issue, you need to ensure the validator address (with the cosmosvaloper prefix) is properly 
assigned in the genesis file or any relevant configuration.

You should use the cosmos prefix for regular addresses and cosmosvaloper for validator addresses in the 
appropriate fields in your configuration files.


From Brydon: 
Don't think of it as an AI but as a coworker (a junior swe). your goal is to:
create a task (a repo in some initial state + a prompt) for that junior swe
i.e. fix this bug, or insert this feature, or do this code migration, or do this refactor, etc.
create a way to grade that task. imagine you're trying to do like a 30 day review of this junior swe. you want to be objective and write out your criteria before hand.
by assumption "pass all tests" is assumed to be a criteria. you can have held out tests (invisible to the junior swe)
additional programmatic tests are good too. things like "run this bash script and make sure no errors, run this javac command, etc."
and qualitative criteria are especially desired. things like "make sure that the solution given passes these code smell checks" or "make sure the solution given uses these libraries and not these ones, or follows these best practices, or uses such and such internal module instead of an external version" etc.
